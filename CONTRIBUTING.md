# want to help? 🚀

thanks for checking out tik talk! we're building this to make the web feel a bit more alive and chatty.

### how to help
1. **fork** this repo
2. **cool feature?** create a branch (`git checkout -b feature-name`)
3. **code it.** keep it simple.
4. **test it.** make sure chat still works.
5. **send it.** open a pull request.

### stuff we need
- [ ] dark mode (the white is bright lol)
- [ ] better mobile ui
- [ ] message reactions (like emoji reacts)
- [ ] room member list

### some rules
- use 2 spaces for tab
- keep comments simple and lowercase
- don't add heavy libraries if you don't have to

just open an issue if you're stuck or want to discuss an idea. peace! ✌️
